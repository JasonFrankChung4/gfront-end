## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov provides tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It also includes an inventory of government custom code to promote reuse between agencies and provides tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/08/peoples-code).

Code.gov is an open source project, so we invite your contributions, be it in the form of code, design, or ideas.

## Requirements

The development of code.gov is guided by the requirements set forth in https://sourcecode.cio.gov/.

## Questions?

If you have questions, please feel free to [send us an email](mailto:code@gsa.gov).

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, you can use `npm install` to install all of the
project’s dependencies.

You can then run the server using `npm run start`.

By default, the development server will listen on <http://localhost:8080/>. You can change the default port by setting the `PORT` environment variable before starting the server (for example, `PORT=3000 npm start`).

## Testing

Unit testing is done using the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) framework with [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). 

Use `npm run test` to run unit tests a single time. This will generate a code coverage report.

Use `npm run test-watch` to run unit tests continuously, re-running each time a file is saved. By default only files changed since the last commit will be ran, follow the command line prompt for customizing how tests are ran. Snapshot tests can be updated while running this command, by pressing `u` to updated them.

Note: console.log/warn/error are mocked in unit tests and will not print anything to avoid cluttering the command line. Use a different logging, such as console.info for debugging while running tests

## Deploying Arbitrary Branch
Coming soon!


## Specifying an API Key
The app uses the API key provided in the site.json by default.
If you want to override that, specify an `CODE_GOV_API_KEY` environmental variable.  Here's an example:
```
CODE_GOV_API_KEY=l87sfdi7ybc2bic7bai8cb2i176c3b872tb3 npm run start
```


## Generating License Data
To update the `dependency_licenses.json` file, run `npm run licenses`.

## File Structure
The directories in `src` are organized around the pillars of  React, along
with several additional custom file types. When creating new files, be sure to
add your file and any necessary templates, styles, and tests to a directory
dedicated to your new file in the appropriate place.


## Style Guide
We've moved the bulk of the CSS for this application into a [Style Guide repository](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-style) so that we can more easily keep things consistent and deploy changes more quickly.

You'll need to clone/download the [Style Guide repository](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-style) to get started.

If you need to make CSS changes, make them within this directory and commit them to that repository.

For more instructions on how to make changes, view the readme inside of the [Style Guide repository](https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-style).
