<p>
  The <a href="https://sourcecode.cio.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Source Code Policy</a> (FSCP)
  called for the establishment of the the Code.gov program office and corresponding technical
  platform of a website and application programming interface (API). The program office assists
  agencies with policy, acquisition, and code inventory creation. We are a small but mighty team
  with five members with expertise and beliefs pertaining to discovering, sharing, and open sourcing
  the People's code.

<h2 id="aboutthesourcecodepolicy">The Federal Source Code Policy</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="https://sourcecode.cio.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Source Code Policy</a> (FSCP)
  was designed to support reuse and public access to custom-developed federal source code. It
  requires new custom-developed source code developed specifically by or for the federal government
  to be made available for sharing and re-use across all Federal agencies. Furthermore, the policy
  supports publishing open source software (OSS).
